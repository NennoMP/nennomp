I am a Research Fellow in Computer Science at [UniPi](https://di.unipi.it/en/), supervised by [Claudio Gallicchio](https://sites.google.com/site/cgallicch/).

I am interested in Deep Learning and Reservoir Computing, with emphasis on efficient and stable (deep) neural networks. I am also involved in [NEURONE](https://sites.google.com/unipi.it/neurone), an EU-funded project which focuses on efficient neuromorphic AI systems.
